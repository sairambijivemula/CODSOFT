Codsoft Internship Movie Genre Classification
Movie genre classification is the process of automatically categorizing movies into different genres based on their content, themes, and characteristics. This task is commonly approached using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Features like plot summaries, keywords, and even audio-visual elements are analyzed to determine the genre of a movie. Challenges in this field include dealing with hybrid genres, ambiguous classifications, and evolving trends in filmmaking that blur traditional genreÂ boundaries
